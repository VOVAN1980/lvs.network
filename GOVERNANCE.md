# Governance Model — LVS Network

LVS Network is designed as a long-lived, autonomous value system.  
Although the protocol is autonomous, its *evolution* and *integrity* require structured human governance.

This document defines Governance v1.

---

## 1. Foundational Principles

- **Human-centered** — LVS serves people, not institutions.  
- **Independence** — no political, corporate, or financial control.  
- **Transparency** — clear rules, predictable decision processes.  
- **Longevity** — the system must outlive its creators.  
- **Minimal authority** — governance exists only to maintain stability.

---

## 2. Current Governance (Development Phase)

During the initial phase, governance is founder-led:

- **Founder** — initiates and approves architectural decisions  
- **Core Engineering Team** — designs and maintains protocol logic  
- **Security Group** — approves updates affecting consensus or system safety  

This model remains active until stable Testnet v1.

## 3. Upgrade Process (LIP — LVS Improvement Proposals)

Future protocol changes follow the LIP workflow:

1. Proposal drafted  
2. Technical review  
3. Security analysis  
4. Community feedback  
5. Formal approval  
6. Implemented and released  

No “instant changes”, no hidden modifications, no unilateral upgrades.

---

## 4. Long-Term Governance (Post-Launch)

After Mainnet:

- LVS Foundation oversees continuity and legal protection  
- Technical Council maintains protocol standards  
- Improvement Proposals remain mandatory  
- No token-based voting  
- No corporate ownership  
- No political influence  

The system prioritizes **stability over popularity**.

---

## 5. Non-Goals

The governance of LVS will NOT:

- allow token-vote control  
- place power in governments or corporations  
- be influenced by financial groups  
- implement forced updates  
- become a political mechanism  

LVS must stay independent and human-protective.

## 6. Amendments

This Governance Model (v1) may evolve during Testnet and early Mainnet as the system matures.
