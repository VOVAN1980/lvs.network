# Security Policy – LVS Core


LVS Core is a security-sensitive research project. Thank you for helping keep it safe.


## Scope


This repository includes:


- TypeScript reference implementation (`src/`)
- Documentation and research materials (`docs/`)
- LVS Improvement Proposals (`lips/`)


No production network or mainnet code is hosted here yet, but bugs may still
impact users of derived implementations.

## Reporting a vulnerability


Please report security issues **privately**.


- Email: security@lvs.network (to be configured)
- Type: responsible disclosure


Do **NOT**:


- publish vulnerabilities publicly before a fix is available;
- create public GitHub issues describing the vulnerability in detail;
- discuss vulnerabilities in public chats or social networks.


We aim to:


- acknowledge your report within **72 hours**;
- provide a status update within **7 days**;
- coordinate disclosure and credit once a fix is ready.


---


## Out of scope


- Typographical errors and minor documentation issues.
- Vulnerabilities in third‑party dependencies outside our control.
- Issues in forks or modified versions of the code.

## Future bounty program


A formal security bounty program may be introduced when LVS reaches public testnet or mainnet stages.
