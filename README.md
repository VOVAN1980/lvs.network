# LVS Network — Living Value System

LVS Network is a next-generation, autonomous value infrastructure designed to operate as a resilient digital layer for human society.  
The system is engineered for long-term stability, transparency, security, and independence from political or corporate control.  
LVS is not a blockchain clone — it is a self-regulated value architecture with its own protocol, its own consensus model (Drift™), and its own node ecosystem.

This repository contains the complete documentation set, technical specifications, product materials, and the public website for LVS Network.

## 1. Project Overview

LVS Network (Living Value System) is built to:

- provide a safe and predictable digital value environment  
- protect people from systemic fragility, political pressure, and centralized manipulation  
- operate autonomously and transparently  
- scale globally using a hybrid node + micro-node architecture  
- enable sustainable evolution with human oversight  

LVS is created **for people**, but engineered to function independently — a long-lived, self-balancing system.

## 6. Status

LVS documentation is fully structured, unified, and stored in this repository.  
The system now enters the active development phase:

- Core protocol implementation  
- Drift consensus prototype  
- Node infrastructure  
- Micro-node architecture  
- Testnet deployment  
- Tooling & API development  

---

## 7. Philosophy

LVS is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Human protection** — technology must strengthen human stability, not replace it.  
2. **Autonomy** — the system must survive political, financial, or organizational collapse.  
3. **Transparency** — clear rules, predictable behavior, open documentation.

LVS is designed as a system that can live longer than its creators.
