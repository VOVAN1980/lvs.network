## Overview

This repository hosts the **public website** of  
**LVS — Living Value System**, a new distributed digital-value architecture defined in the official LVS documentation set:

- LVS Whitepaper  
- Technical Architecture :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Drift Consensus Specification  
- Protocol Specification  
- Developer Guide  
- Security Deep Dive  
- Testnet Launch Plan :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Research Paper Draft  
- Master Document  
- Pitch Deck  
- Investor One-Pager  

All these documents were imported into the LVS project library and unified into a consistent, up-to-date specification.  
They define the architecture and mechanisms of the **Autonomous Value Layer (AVL)**.

The **lvs.network** website provides:

- public landing page,  
- documentation entry points,  
- legal & governance materials,  
- browser-node MVP demo,  
- assets and branding.  

The **LVS Core implementation** (Rust + TypeScript engines) lives in a separate repo and is licensed independently.

## Live Demo

### 🔹 Browser Node (MVP)  
Runs your browser as a real LVS micro-node:

- SDM send/receive  
- drift update  
- peer list  
- VU/TC sync  
- live canvas visualization  
- connection to Rust gateway  

This demo is documented in:

- MVP Architecture  
- Technical Architecture  
- Testnet Launch Plan  

The browser node is a fully working participant of the LVS network.

## What LVS Is

According to official documents (Whitepaper, Technical Architecture, Drift Consensus Spec):

LVS is **not blockchain**, **not DAG**, **not BFT**, and has:

- no blocks  
- no mining  
- no history  
- no identity  
- no validators  
- no governance  
- no staking  
- no majority voting  

LVS introduces:

### ✔ Drift-Based Consensus (DBC)  
Nodes exchange SDM packets and converge by correction vectors.  
Documented in Drift Consensus Spec & Technical Architecture.

### ✔ Value State Engine (VU / TC)  
Documented in Protocol Specification.

### ✔ VaultGuard  
Protects value from catastrophic loss (Consensus Spec, Developer Guide).

### ✔ Micro-node architecture  
Browser nodes, Rust nodes, IoT nodes — unified drift engine.

### ✔ Zero-Identity Framework  
System-level anonymity and Sybil-resistance without identity or accounts.

This is the first real implementation of an **Autonomous Value Layer (AVL)**.
