<h1>LVS — Terms of Use</h1>

<p>Last updated: November 2025</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>
  By accessing the LVS website, the LVS Browser Node, or any testnet demonstration,
  you acknowledge and agree to these Terms of Use.  
  If you do not agree, you must discontinue use.
</p>

<h2>2. Nature of the System</h2>
<p>
  LVS (Living Value System) is a distributed protocol for value drift computation,
  trust-credit weighting, and decentralized synchronization mechanisms.
  The Browser Node is a visualization and experimental tool, not a production wallet,
  financial system, or investment platform.
</p>

<h2>3. No Financial Services</h2>
<p>
  LVS does not provide:
</p>

<p>
  • financial advice  
  • investment products  
  • token sales  
  • yield products  
  • or monetary guarantees  
</p>

<p>
  All simulations shown in the Browser Node are mathematical dynamics
  and have no monetary or asset-backed meaning.
</p>

<h2>4. No Warranty</h2>
<p>
  LVS and its testnet tools are provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind.
  We make no guarantee of uptime, accuracy, completeness, or performance.
  Users participate at their own risk.
</p>

<h2>5. Open-Source Components</h2>
<p>
  The project contains open-source code in Rust and TypeScript,
  licensed under permissive terms available in the official repository:
  <a href="https://github.com/VOVAN1980" target="_blank">github.com/VOVAN1980</a>.
</p>

<h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
  You agree not to:
</p>

<p>
  • disrupt the network or gateway  
  • falsify node identity  
  • conduct automated attacks  
  • reverse-engineer private infrastructure  
</p>

<p>
  Standard code audits, forks, and open-source contributions are permitted.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  The LVS maintainers and contributors are not liable for damages or losses of any kind,
  including (but not limited to) outages, data inconsistencies, or misinterpretation of metrics.
</p>

<h2>8. External Links</h2>
<p>
  Links to GitHub, PDF documents, or third-party resources are provided for convenience.
  We are not responsible for external content.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>
  These terms may be updated at any time. Continued use constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
